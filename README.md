Welcome! 

This is my location-aware music web application that automatically plays different music depending on where you are on the USC campus.

Frontend: React, Vite, JavaScript, HTML5 Audio API, Browser Geolocation API
Backend: Node.js, Express.js, JSON file storage (zones.json), Static file serving for MP3 files

How to run: Right now, it only runs locally. Here are the command line arguments to run in different instances of the console

Backend: cd backend
         npm install
         node server.js

Frontend: cd frontend
          npm install
          npm run dev

Version 1.0 - Inludes: Marshall School of Business, Thornton School of Music, Leavey Library

Thanks!
